### Unsupervised Image Segmentation using K-means 
With this project we attempt to do unsupervised image segmentation using the k-means algorithm.
We attempt to use high dimensional images to get a better segmentation from k-means.
The eda for out datasets is in the ImageSegmentationEDA.ipynb file. The image segmentation code is availbale in the  ImageSegmentation.ipynb file.
Pets dataset is available at https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/pets/.
Drone dataset is available at http://dronedataset.icg.tugraz.at.
